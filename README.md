# VolunEgy
I present this application titled "VolunEgy" to gather data about all volunteers and their volunteer activities, aiming to facilitate the Egyptian government's digital transformation in directing them digitally towards raising public awareness and assisting during times of crises and emergencies. The idea of the application is simple, you can apply for volunteer jobs or add your own volunteer job. The application is built using [flutter](https://flutter.dev/) and [dart](https://dart.dev/).


## To Use
###### You can download the `.apk` file from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kZ0HfP753_aShVyWskY57pYWlTIGdh4Y/view?usp=drive_link)

## To Build the App
Make sure [flutter](https://flutter.dev/) and [dart](https://dart.dev/) are installed. 

To check if everything is working fine, just run flutter doctor from the console:
```console
flutter doctor
```

Now just build the application for your favorite platform:
```console
flutter build <platform>
```
where `<platform>` is either `apk` or `ios`.
